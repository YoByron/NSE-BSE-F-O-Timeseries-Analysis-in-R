# NSE-BSE-F-O-Timeseries-Analysis-in-R

Features incorporated so far : 
1. NSE/BSE Timeseries in R 
2. Bhavcopy,
3. Bhavcopy F&O
4. FII/DII Plot based on ggplot2
5. Crypto data 
6. Candlestick charts.

Future Target: Using R to create Mathematical Predictory Models for optimizing Option Strategies, based on Blackâ€“Scholes model. Unsure of the possibility, but I will definitely try my best. Want to look at AI and machine learning too, provided I obtain data for the same. Because of my educational background, I also want to work on using Markov chains in the derivatives domain.
