NSE-BSE-F-O-Timeseries-Analysis-in-R

Features incorporated so far : NSE/BSE Timeseries in R , bhavcopy, bhavcopy F&O, FII/DII Plot, Crypto data and candlestick charts.

Future Target: Using R to create Mathematical Predictory Models for optimizing Option Strategies, based on Blackâ€“Scholes model. Unsure of the possibility, but I will definitely try my best. Want to look at AI and machine learning too, provided I obtain data for the same.
